This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving the `useEffect` hook and its cleanup function. The bug manifests when the cleanup function attempts to interact with the component's state or other resources after the component has unmounted, leading to silent errors and unexpected behavior. The solution provided demonstrates how to effectively prevent this issue by checking if the component is still mounted before performing any state-modifying operations within the cleanup function.
